1. **Substitution**. The model substitutes the answer back to the question to check if it fits all the conditions. By inspecting the solutions we randomly sampled from the results, we found that this is the most common type of verification.

**Example**:
> **Question:** Suppose that the minimum value of $f(x) = \cos 2x - 2a (1 + \cos x)$ is $-\frac{1}{2}.$  Find $a.$
**Solution:**
......
Next, we will verify this solution by substituting $ a = -0.25 $ into the function $ f(x) $, and checking whether the minimum value of $ f(x) $ is indeed $ -\frac{1}{2} $. We will evaluate $ f(x) $ over the interval $ [0, 2\pi] $ because the function is periodic with period $ 2\pi $.
```python
# Substitute a = -0.25 into f(x)
f_substituted = f.subs(a, -0.25)

# Define a function for numerical evaluation
f_num = sp.lambdify(x, f_substituted, "numpy")

# Evaluate f(x) over the interval [0, 2*pi]
import numpy as np
x_values = np.linspace(0, 2*np.pi, 1000)
f_values = f_num(x_values)

# Find the minimum value of f(x)
f_min = np.min(f_values)
```

2. **Alternative Method**. The model uses a different method to solve the problem and check if it reaches the same final answer.

**Example**:
> **Question:** What is the value of the following expression: $100 - 99 +98 - 97 + 96 - 95 + \cdots + 4 - 3 +2 - 1$?$
**Solution:**
......
Now, let's verify this result by actually computing the expression term by term. We'll create a list of numbers from 100 down to 1, then add the even-indexed numbers and subtract the odd-indexed numbers.
```python
# create a list of numbers from 100 down to 1
numbers = list(range(100, 0, -1))

# compute the expression term by term
total_check = 0
for i, num in enumerate(numbers):
    if i % 2 == 0:
        total_check += num
    else:
        total_check -= num

total_check
```

3. **Double Checking**. The model double-checks each part of the solution to see if they are correct.

**Example**:
> **Question:** What is the greatest prime factor of the sum of the arithmetic sequence $1 + 2 + 3 + \cdots + 80$?$
**Solution:**
......
Now, let's verify the solution.
First, we will generate the sequence from 1 to 80, sum it up, and confirm that it is equal to 3240.
Then, we will calculate the product of the prime factors and confirm that it is also equal to 3240.
Finally, we will check that the maximum prime factor is indeed 5.
```python
# Generate the sequence from 1 to 80
sequence = list(range(1, n+1))

# Confirm the sum of the sequence
assert sum(sequence) == S, "The sum of the sequence is not correct."

# Confirm the product of the prime factors
from functools import reduce
import operator
assert reduce(operator.mul, prime_factors_S, 1) == S, "The product of the prime factors is not correct."

# Confirm the maximum prime factor
assert max(prime_factors_S) == greatest_prime_factor, "The maximum prime factor is not correct."

"Verification passed."
```

These four types mostly summarized the types of verification code used. 

4. **Approximation**. The model compute an approximation of the answer. This method is usually used when there is infinity involved in the problems. The model use a large number to approximate the infinity to check if the result is close to the answer.

**Example**:
> **Question:** What is the value of $\sum_{n=1}^\infty  (\tan^{-1}\sqrt{n}-\tan^{-1}\sqrt{n+1})$?
Your answer should be in radians.
**Solution:**
......
Now, let's verify the solution. We can do this by calculating the sum of the first few terms of the series and see if it is close to our solution. Note that the series is infinite, so we can't compute the exact value in this way, but we can check if it seems to be converging towards our solution. Let's calculate the sum of the first 10,000 terms.
```python
# calculate the sum of the first 10000 terms
sum_of_terms = 0
for n in range(1, 10001):
    sum_of_terms += math.atan(math.sqrt(n)) - math.atan(math.sqrt(n+1))

sum_of_terms
```
